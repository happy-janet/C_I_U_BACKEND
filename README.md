# Examination Monitoring System

The system aims to create a comprehensive online examination monitoring solution. It
incorporates advanced proctoring techniques, including capturing random images and voice
samples during the exam. A safe browser feature that prevents users from accessing
unauthorised resources by restricting their ability to open or switch to other applications. The
system provides a platform for lecturers to create and manage a question bank with both
quiz and structured questions. Real-time logs and analytics will ensure transparent and
immediate monitoring, all while being optimised for low-bandwidth environments.
Additionally, Single Sign-On (SSO) is integrated to streamline user authentication and
improve security across the platform, exam window after a warning, and logging any
disruptions such as electricity outages. Students will be able to resume exams from where
they stopped. The system also manages exam timing with auto-submission if time is
exceeded, compresses photos and voice recordings to save space, and includes a grading system.
